No images involved.\r\n\r\nExample buttons with custom colours:\r\n\r\n![Button preview](http://www.fidgetbox.co.uk/mrsubtlebutton2.png)\r\n\r\n##Usage\r\nMRSubtleButton can be integrated into an existing project using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Simply add the necessary dependency to your `Podfile` as follows:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nplatform :osx, '10.7'\r\npod 'MRSubtleButton'\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `pod install` to install.\r\n\r\nNext, drag a custom view from the object library in Xcode into your UI, and change its class to MRSubtleButton.\r\n\r\nCreate an outlet for the button and implement the `<MRSubtleButtonDelegate>` protocol in your controller with the following method:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n- (void)MRSubtleButtonEvent:(NSEvent *)event with:(id)sender;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, set the button's delegate to your controller object: `[button setDelegate:self]` and give the button a title: `[button setTitle:@\"Hello World!\"]`.\r\n\r\nIf you have more than one button with the same delegate you can determine which button was pressed by inspecting its title:\r\n\r\n```objc\r\n- (void)MRSubtleButtonEvent:(NSEvent *)event with:(id)sender\r\n{\r\n  // assuming sender is of class MRSubtleButton\r\n  if ([[sender title] isEqualToString:@\"Hello World!\"])\r\n  {\r\n    // your button event implementation\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Caveats\r\nPlease note that the source code uses ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and has only been tested against 10.7 and 10.8 deployment targets.\r\n\r\n##License\r\n`MRSubtleButton` is provided under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\r\n\r\n##Comments or suggestions?\r\nEmail me at [marc.ransome@fidgetbox.co.uk](mailto://marc.ransome@fidgetbox.co.uk) with bugs, feature requests or general comments and follow [@marcransome](http://www.twitter.com/marcransome) for updates.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
